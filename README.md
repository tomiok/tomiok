### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Tomas and I am from Argentina, happy to see you here.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in Google, mostly with Go and running a (gopher) youtube channel, I am 
   actively uploading videos with tips, techniques, new frameworks, patterns and so on, all the 
   content in the channel is in Spanish. Take a look at my [channel](https://youtube.com/tomaslingotti).

- ðŸ’¥ I am also running a Discord server, for Gophers but you can also ask about any engineering issue/topic (in spanish as well), [feel free to join](https://discord.io/go-latam).

- ðŸŒ± Here I have lot of unused code but I am working in [fuego-cache](https://github.com/tomiok/fuego-cache) and [tomatto-logger](https://github.com/tomiok/tomatto-logger) which    are two libraries in Golang, feel free to send any PR or see the issues.

- âš¡ Currently writing experimental code for several things, but for my, except from work, everything is public so if any idea cames up, send me a ping (you can see gRPC, lot of REST services, CLI apps, etc).
