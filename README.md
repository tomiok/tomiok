### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Tomas and I am from Argentina, happy to see you here.

- ðŸ‘¾ PRODUCT HUNT NOW (updated at dicember 2021) ðŸ‘¾

- ðŸš€ Building 1 new app to improve the citizens wellbeing, soon will be available.

- ðŸ’¯ In this repo you can find good quality repos, feel free to contact me if anything caught your attention.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working mostly with Go and running a (gopher) [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/tomaslingotti), I am 
   actively uploading videos with tips, techniques, new frameworks, patterns and so on, all the 
   content in the channel is in Spanish. I am glad to receive feedback or new topics for my videos.

- ðŸ’¥ I am also running a [Discord server](https://discord.io/go-latam), for Gophers but you can also ask about any engineering issue/topic (in spanish as well), feel free to join and take a look to all the discusions, posts, challenges and even job postings.

- ðŸŒ± Here I have lot of unused code but I am working in [fuego-cache](https://github.com/tomiok/fuego-cache) (a key/value superfast cache, with 3 interfaces (cli, tcp and HTTP) and very friendly for any language), [clipper](https://github.com/tomiok/clipper) (a Hystrix inspired circuit breaker)and [splanner](https://github.com/tomiok/splanner) (a pool with concurrent workers), feel free to send any PR or see the issues.

- âš¡ Currently writing experimental code for several things, but for my, except from work, everything is public so if any idea cames up, send me a ping (you can see gRPC, lot of REST services, CLI apps, etc).
