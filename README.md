- 🔭 I’m currently working mostly with Go and running a (gopher) [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/tomaslingotti), I am 
   actively uploading videos with tips, techniques, new frameworks, patterns and so on, all the 
   content in the channel is in Spanish. I am glad to receive feedback or new topics for my videos.
